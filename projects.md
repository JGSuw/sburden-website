## Sensorimotor Games
In tasks involving adaptive algorithms and continuously-learning humans, 
rich dynamic behaviors can prevent the system from reaching consensus. 
We investigate these fundamental phenomena from the framework of
continuous games, in which `players' in this game each have their own preferences
that may be misaligned with one another, through different task definitions 
or limited communication or trust.

The performance and robustness of  a robot gait is sensitive to both the intrinsic characteristics of the robot and the properties of the terrain in which the robot operates. Often computationally efficient models for calculating the ground reaction force of a given terrain are not available, which adds difficulty to designing robots and gaits by optimization in simulation. We propose a mixed-reality design paradigm, wherein physical robot hardware is coupled to a simulation of virtual robot dynamics in real time through a haptic force rendering system. We apply this approach to the task of synthesizing a hopping gait for a real 2-DOF robotic leg while simultaneously designing a passive suspension for a virtual load mass. By physically realizing the ground reaction force of different terrains, while coupling the robot leg to a virtual spring-mass system, we seek to bridge the gap between simulation and real robot.
